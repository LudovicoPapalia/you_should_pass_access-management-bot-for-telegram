## Introduction

The Access Management Telegram Bot is designed to automate the processing of join requests and improve communication between the group members and its administrators. By using this bot, administrators can efficiently manage access to their Telegram group, ensuring a streamlined vetting process.

## How it works and functionality

- When someone makes a request to join Group A, they immediately receive a message (currently: your request is under review).
- The message is correctly received even if the bot was never started by the requester. The bot **must** be admin of group A
- A new request notification is sent to the admins on Group B.
- The user who made the request can reply via the bot with a normal message, and the message will be forwarded to Group B/Admin.
- If an admin wants to reply, they must "quote" the message they are replying to and can respond directly through the group.
- The message that was replied to by "quoting" is automatically forwarded to the requesting user.
- Any message that is written to the bot being created (only private messages) is automatically forwarded to the admin group. Group A messages are obviously not forwarded.

It is imperative that users verify and test the code thoroughly according to their own requirements and standards to ensure its suitability for their intended use.

2. **No Affiliation with Bots or Groups**: The author(s) of this code **are not affiliated with any bots, groups, or entities where this code may be implemented or utilized**, even if a link to this repository is found within a bot or associated with a group. The presence of a repository link within a bot does not imply any connection or endorsement by the codeâ€™s author(s) to the bot, its operations, or the group it serves. The code is provided openly for anyone to use, and its application is solely at the discretion of those who choose to implement it. The author(s) disclaim any relationship with the operations, functionalities, or actions of such bots or groups derived from the use of this code. The developers do not endorse any group that may use this code directly or indirectly.

3. **No Access to Chats**: The author(s) do not have, nor do they seek, access to any chats or private information that may be associated with the deployment of this code. The code is designed without any capability to grant access to its author(s) to any group chats or private communications. Access to such environments is strictly governed by the possession and management of an API key, which is the sole responsibility of the individual or entity choosing to deploy this code. The security and confidentiality of the API key, and by extension the privacy of the chats, rest entirely with the deployer.
For the author of this code there is no possibility of accessing the chats as you will create your own bot and will be responsible for the keys. You are also fully responsible for additional security checks of the bot including - but not limited to - checking third-party libraries and the bot's hosting server.

## Requirements and Setup

### Bot Creation and Configuration
1. **Create a Bot**: Use BotFather on Telegram to create a new bot. Note the generated `TOKEN`.
2. **Enable Group Privacy**: **Disable** the **Group Privacy** setting from BotFather to allow the bot to read all messages in a group.
3. Add the bot to group A and group B and **make it admin**
4. **Obtain Group IDs**: Use the @chatIDrobot on Telegram to find the IDs of your main group (GROUP_A_ID) and your admin group (GROUP_B_ID). Remember, group IDs usually start with a "-".

### Python and Dependencies
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed.
- **Requests Library**: Install the `requests` library using pip:
  ```
  pip install requests
  ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository (optional!)**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/you_should_pass_access-management-bot-for-telegram.git
   ```
2. **Configuration**: Open the script and replace `TOKEN`, `GROUP_A_ID`, and `GROUP_B_ID` with the respective values obtained during the setup process.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install required Python libraries as mentioned in the [Requirements and Setup](#requirements-and-setup) section.

## Usage

To start the bot, navigate to the bot's directory and execute:
```
python bot_ammission_toshare_v1.py
```
The bot will now listen for join requests and messages, handling them according to the configured logic.

**To work correctly the bot must be added as admin of groups A and B and must be able to read ALL messages sent**

## Technical Details

The bot operates by monitoring two types of updates: join requests and messages. When a join request is detected in the main group, it notifies the admin group for review. Messages from non-admin groups are forwarded to the admin group for potential actions or responses.

### Core Functions
- `send_message()`: Sends messages to specified chat IDs.
- `forward_message_to_admin()`: Forwards messages from users to the admin group with user identification.
- `handle_updates()`: Checks for new updates and processes join requests and messages accordingly.

The bot employs a polling mechanism to continuously check for updates and handle them in real-time.
