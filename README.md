## Introduction

The Access Management Telegram Bot is designed to automate the processing of join requests and improve communication between the group members and its administrators. By using this bot, administrators can efficiently manage access to their Telegram group, ensuring a streamlined vetting process.

When someone makes a request to join Group A, they immediately receive a message (currently: your request is under review).
A new request notification is sent to the admins on Group B.
The user who made the request can reply via the bot with a normal message, and the message will be forwarded to Group B/Admin.
If an admin wants to reply, they must "quote" the message they are replying to and can respond directly through the group.
The message that was replied to by "quoting" is automatically forwarded to the requesting user.
Any message that is written to the group being created is automatically forwarded to the admin group.

## How it works and functionality

- When someone makes a request to join Group A, they immediately receive a message (currently: your request is under review).
- A new request notification is sent to the admins on Group B.
- The user who made the request can reply via the bot with a normal message, and the message will be forwarded to Group B/Admin.
- If an admin wants to reply, they must "quote" the message they are replying to and can respond directly through the group.
- The message that was replied to by "quoting" is automatically forwarded to the requesting user.
- Any message that is written to the group being created is automatically forwarded to the admin group.

## Requirements and Setup

### Bot Creation and Configuration
1. **Create a Bot**: Use BotFather on Telegram to create a new bot. Note the generated `TOKEN`.
2. **Enable Group Privacy**: Disable the Group Privacy setting from BotFather to allow the bot to read all messages in a group.
3. **Obtain Group IDs**: Use the @chatIDrobot on Telegram to find the IDs of your main group (GROUP_A_ID) and your admin group (GROUP_B_ID). Remember, group IDs usually start with a "-".

### Python and Dependencies
- **Python**: Ensure Python 3.6 or newer is installed.
- **Requests Library**: Install the `requests` library using pip:
  ```
  pip install requests
  ```

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository (optional!)**: 
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/you_should_pass_access-management-bot-for-telegram.git
   ```
2. **Configuration**: Open the script and replace `TOKEN`, `GROUP_A_ID`, and `GROUP_B_ID` with the respective values obtained during the setup process.
3. **Install Dependencies**: Install required Python libraries as mentioned in the [Requirements and Setup](#requirements-and-setup) section.

## Usage

To start the bot, navigate to the bot's directory and execute:
```
python bot_ammission_toshare_v1.py
```
The bot will now listen for join requests and messages, handling them according to the configured logic.

## Technical Details

The bot operates by monitoring two types of updates: join requests and messages. When a join request is detected in the main group, it notifies the admin group for review. Messages from non-admin groups are forwarded to the admin group for potential actions or responses.

### Core Functions
- `send_message()`: Sends messages to specified chat IDs.
- `forward_message_to_admin()`: Forwards messages from users to the admin group with user identification.
- `handle_updates()`: Checks for new updates and processes join requests and messages accordingly.

The bot employs a polling mechanism to continuously check for updates and handle them in real-time.
